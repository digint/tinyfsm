TinyFSM
=======

TinyFSM is a simple finite state machine library for C++, designed for
optimal performance and low memory footprint. This makes it ideal for
real-time operating systems. The concept is very simple, allowing the
programmer to fully understand what is happening behind the scenes. It
provides a straightforward way of mapping your state machine charts
into source code.

TinyFSM basically wraps event dispatching into function calls, making
event dispatching equally fast to calling (or even inlining) a
function. Even in the worst case, dispatching leads to nothing more
than a single vtable lookup and function call!

Key Features:

 - Entry/exit actions
 - Event actions
 - Transition functions
 - Transition conditions
 - Event payload (classes)
 - Inheritance of states and action functions

TinyFSM benefits from the C++11 template metaprogramming features like
variadic templates, and does not depend on RTTI, exceptions or any
external library.

Current version: `0.3.2`


Documentation
-------------

You can find the main documentation in the `doc/` directory of the
TinyFSM project. The latest version is also available
[online](https://digint.ch/tinyfsm/doc/introduction.html).


Installation
------------

TinyFSM is a header-only library, no special installation steps are
needed. Just point your compiler to the "include" directory.

Alternately, you could install the library using cmake. A typical install procedure is:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
sudo cmake --build . --target install
```

In your project `CMakeLists.txt`, configure this library by including:
```cmake
find_package(tinyfsm)
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} tinyfsm)
```

Hopefully this works on any OS. It should copy the library to the right os-specific location so you can succesfully `#include <tinyfsm.hpp>`. It will also create the cmake specific files that will allow you to use `find_package(tinyfsm)` in your cmake scripts.
